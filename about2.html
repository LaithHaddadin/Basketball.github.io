          <div class="one" style="padding:2%;"><br><p style="text-indent:4%;">One of the things that you need when you're playing basketball are basketball shoes. If you are playing basketball just for fun or you're playing street basketball, basketball  shoes aren't required or aren't as important meaning that you don't need them. However, if you are playing games in a tournament or professional basketball, baseketball shoes are important because they help with your movement. Therefore, if you are going to buy basketball shoes, I recommend to use <b>Nike Shoes</b> or <b>Under Armour Shoes</b>.</p></div>
          <div class="two" style="padding:2%;"><br><p style="text-indent:4%;">One basic object that you need when playing basketball is the ball itself. If you are playing a professional game, you don't need to worry about not having a ball, however, if are playing outside or street basketball, you need to get a ball in order to be able to play.</p></div>
          <div class="three" style="padding:2%;"><br><p style="text-indent:4%;">Another basic thing that you need is the hoop itself also called basket board. If you want to play basketball in your backyard, you need to get a basketboard in order to play. If you are playing in any game, built in hoops or boards will be provided to you.</p></div>
