	</div>

    <div class="box-1">
      <div class="one-1"><p>In basketball, there are two main objectives and they are to score a basket, and to prevent a basket. There are multiple ways to score a basket. However the one thing you can't do when trying to score is to hope for the best and play whatever you feel like doing, because it doesn't guarentee points. To increase the chances of scoring against the other team, offensive strategies where made to play and pass by the defending team.<br><br>There are 5 players that play 5 different positions. <u>These positions are:</u><ol><li>The <b>Point Guard</b></li><li>The <b>Guards</b> on each wing</li><li>The <b>Center</b></li><li>The <b>Baseline</b> or <b>Forward.</b></li></ol> After some time, attackers started creating the offensive strategies using those positions to work together, as a team, leading them to score against their opposing team. One offense that are mostly used is <b>The Motion Offense</b>.</p></div>

        <div class="one-1">
            <p>The motion offense is mostly used in a basketball game because of how easy it is to learn the concepts of that offense. This offense is different than the other offenses because it doesn't have any plays but is based on the concept of a set of philosophies and choices that the defender makes. The motion offense involes and flows by using ball screens, cuts, passing, player movement, and good spacing.<br><br></p><p style="text-indent: 4%;">To run a motion offense, the point guard starts with the ball entering the other teams' half court. Once that happens, the point guard can either give the ball to one of the guards on the wings or to the center. If the center is open and the point gives the ball to the center, one of the guards on the wings cuts towards that basket in a sudden move surprising the defender. As that guard is cutting towards the hoop, the center passes and gives the ball to the guard leaving the guard with the ball with a clear and open layup. That is one way to run the motion offense.</p><br><br><p style="text-indent: 4%;">Another way to run the motion offense is if the point guard gives one of the guards on the wings the ball. If that happens, the point guards screens away meaning that the point guard goes the opposite direction in which he passed and then screens the defender on his fellow guard. Once the screen is made, the guard switches locations with the point and is now at the top of the key. Since the other guard has the ball, that guard has multiple options and they are to shoot the ball, to give the ball to the baseline, and to use the screen set to you by the center. If the guard gives the ball to the baseline, that guard cuts towards the hoop from the front side of the defender and then as that is happening, the baseline gives a pass to the guard and then continues the layup. If the guard couldn't get the pass, he continues and then the center cuts the same way as the guard and then recieves the ball into a layup. The second option that the guard could have done if he didn't pass to the baseline would be to use the screen set to him by the center. Once the guard takes that screen, he has two options and they are to shoot the ball or to continue a layup. If both these options arn't available, the guard needs to pass to a teamate in order to reset the motion offense. That is the general idea of how a motion offense works.</p>
