	</div>

    <div class="box-1">
      <div class="one-1">The second main objective in basketball is to defend your basket and prevent your oposing team to score a basket. To do that, your team needs to develop and use some defensive strategies that would prevent from happening. We need to develop defensive strategies because we know that the opposing team is going to use an offensive play and strategy. We are going to look and see some examples of definsive strategies that are used in professional basketball.</div>

            <p>There are a lot of defensive strategies used in basketball and each of these strategies have their own strengths and weakness. However, there are two specific strategies that are mostly used and they are the man to man defense and the 2-3 zone defense. The images bellow give us an idea of how these strategies are played. The left image shows man to man defense is played while the right image shows us the 2-3 zone defense.</p>

            <p style="background-color:#518996;"><br>A man to man defense is simple. In order to fufill your role as a defender, all you need to do is keep on defending your man. In the beginning of the game, each person chooses a man to defend and that is usually set by the closest person to your size and skill set. Onces you set you man, you guard that man and try prevent that person to get the ball while also being ready to help your other fellow defenders.

            <p style="background-color:#518996;"><br>A 2-3 zone defense is one of many other zone defenses where instead of having the defenders guard the attackers, they would be guarding a specific zone. We can see the zones each player defends through the yellow boxes in the picture above. So each player guards their zone and try to prevent a pass from coming into their zone to the attacker. Adding on to that, as the defenders are guarding their zone, they should be facing the attacker with the ball at a 45 degree angle so that they would know how to react once the attacker makes his move. We will talk more about zone defense later on.

           <p>We talked about how there are a number of different zone defenses in basketball but we haven't went into the details. In this image on the right, we can see 5 different zone deffenses(including th 2-3 defense).<br> <u>These zones are:</u> <ul><li>The <b>2-3</b> Zone</li><li>The <b>3-2</b> Zone</li><li>The <b>1-3-1</b> Zone</li><li>The <b>2-1-2</b> Zone</li><li>The <b>1-2-2</b> Zone</li></ul>As we already said, the 2-3 zone is the most common zone layout and defense. In the 2-3 zone defence, two players stand at the free throw line, while the remaining three defenders guard the baseline. This zone defense is best used for defending the baseline and corner attacks, as well as securing rebounds.<br><br>The 3-2 zone defense has three defenders in a line at the free throw line, allowing them to pressure the attackers on the wings, while the other two defenders guard the baseline. This 3-2 zone is a good defense because it makes it harder to shoot long-range shot.<br><br>The 1-3-1 zone defense has one player above the free throw line, three players spread out between the freethrow line and the center position, and one player guarding the baseline right underneath the basketball hoop. This zone defense is a good defense for guarding head-on attacks at the top of the circle and for forcing offenses into corners for potential traps and turnovers.<br><br>The 2-1-2 zone defense has two players guard the free throw line, while one player is placed in the middle and the final two defenders are placed at the baseline. This defense helps defend against baseline attacks.<br><br> The 1-2-2 zone defense is also called the “jug” defense. It has one player guarding above the foul line while two players guard the wings having the final two defenders  responsible for the baseline.
